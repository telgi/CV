# Terry Allitt

*As a lover of language and communication, creating stories has long been a favourite hobby of mine. Now that I have found software development, I can do the thing I love every day.*

*My second and more secretive passion is my compulsion to turn anything and everything into a list. I thrive on standardised practices, and I especially enjoy inventing them.*

*Together, story telling and task building fuel my desire to work on inspirational products that help people. After helping 500+ developers find a new product to work on, I'm exciting to see what will be my first :)*

## Recent Experience

**Developer at Makers** (Jan 2018 to April 2018)

* Enjoyed being a Project Leader during group work - mainly for the planning aspect, but also to craft features in an agile manner.
* Learnt the 'beaudy' of BDD: as a group in week 9, we held each other accountable to test drive our React app, resulting in cleaner, more scalable code than if done without.
* Became a big believer in XP Values - at the end of every day I reflected on whether I had demonstrated all 5 values and how I can improve myself based on these ideas.

**Consultant at WhiteHat** (Dec 2017 to Jan 2018)

* Contracted for 6 weeks to create processes and a roadmap for the curation side of the business.
* Spent first 2 weeks understanding the current workflow and listening to the pain points of the client, turning them into user stories for Engineering to prioritise.
* Rest of time spent mapping out improvements for long term future e.g. restructuring the platform application queues, as well as implementing some quick fixes to alleviate the immediate inefficiencies e.g. deploying an official process to confirm a candidate as 'unresponsive'.

**Curation Specialist at Hired** (Feb 2016 to Nov 2017)

* Joined when the London market had 30 candidates going live each week - hired to drastically increase weekly supply while maintaining a balanced marketplace.
* Used unique hashtags to segment candidate base and build out data via Looker, identifying key opportunities for Marketing and Sales.
* Constructed dashboards for important health metrics, challenging the wider team to be more data-driven.
* Collaborated with Product to implement a number of key features on the platform, e.g. 'real-time push' (allowing candidates to go live immediately Vs fixed weekly batches)
* Helped teach a Machine Learning Model to auto-approve or auto-reject candidates based on reliable data points.
* Left the team on an incredible high by overachieving on placement goal 3 quarters in a row with an average of 120 candidates going live per week.

## Relevant Strengths

**Analytical Attention to Detail**: I've gone from being a stickler for grammar to wanting my code to be as DRY as possible. My degree in English Language, followed by 6 years of assessing applications has made me hyper-sensitive to producing well-structured work, spotting errors and typos, naming things appropriately and all that other inescapable Hawkeye behaviour.

**Continuous Self-Improvement**: Whether it's learning something new or finding ways to make my life better, my personality is one driven by progress. At Hired, I relished having tangible goals to work towards, and even in my personal time, I like to set myself daily objectives to complete, with end of day reflection to see how things went.

**Disciplined Learning Process**: Given that the scope of this field is so astronomic, trying to learn it all would be akin to retaining a universe of knowledge. My learning process is guided by strict prioritisation on what needs to be focused on right now, and what will steadily and efficiently lift me towards the stars.

## Tech Values

    1) Collaborating with a highly-driven team that truly values the users of their product.
    2) Being part of an agile environment where changes are adapted to positively.
    3) Using tech that suits the needs of the business, being the best tools for the job.
